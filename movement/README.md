Experiments in movement.

1_keyboard_driven.bot

An arrow can be driven using the keyboard, it works a bit like a car in an old top-down
game, it has inertia, acceleration braking and can be steered left and right.


2_seperate_behaviours.bot

Movement behaviours are seperated into controller functions that can be used to
create different kinds of 'moveable'.

Two are created, one keyboard driven, one automatic.


3_simple_particles.bot

A very simple particle system is created that outputs an explosion of arrows.
